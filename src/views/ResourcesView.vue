    <h2 class="text-uppercase">What to look out for</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Unfortunately, since the beginning of this crisis, there have been quite a
      few scams circulating around, asking for money under the pretence of
      charity. Not only do they attempt to trick people out of their money, but
      the intended recipients are losing the much-needed assistance.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some of the ways you can avoid this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Make donations through the organisation or charity’s websites. You can
        also get in direct contact with them and ask for more details or
        guidance. Don’t be afraid to do your own research and ask questions. We
        provide direct access to the organisations’ websites where you can find
        out more before donating.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        Organisations that have a long history and good reputation in the field
        are always a safe bet. Those who have a presence in Ukraine, as well as
        partners there, are even better.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        Be careful with direct messages from unknown sources soliciting money,
        as well as emails with links to payment websites.
      </li>
      <li class="my-2">
        Make sure that social media fundraises are legitimate by verifying the
        organisation involved. Your social media contacts might be very
        well-intended in sharing and promoting such charities, but they might
        not have researched it beforehand.
