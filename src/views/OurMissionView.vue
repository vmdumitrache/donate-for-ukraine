      Our aim is to raise awareness of the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. We want to
      do so by facilitating the process of making informed choices when deciding
      to help by not only providing relevant information, but by also giving
      necessary resources for people to do their own research. We want to create
      a place where people can easily find the information they need in order to
      give their support. This support can be in the form of monetary donations
      going directly to the organisations and institutions that are doing their
      best to help, or by simply growing public awareness of the situation
      unfolding.
